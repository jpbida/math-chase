Math Chase is an HTML5 game built with the Phaser framework.  The goal is to collect numbers that add up to a target value without going over, and do it before the robot escapes!  The code is written partially using a compenent-entity design pattern and taking advantage of separated game-state pattern supported by Phaser.
